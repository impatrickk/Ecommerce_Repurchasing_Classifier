# E-commerce Product Repurchasing Classifier
Using data from a major online grocery retail player, we can use machine learning with decision trees and ensembling learning methods to predict whether or not a customer will repurchase a given product. The dataset was provided through Kaggle as part of a competition hosted by Instacart. Now we can build a "similar product" recommender for target advertising or keep an organized inventory plan for the growing business!
